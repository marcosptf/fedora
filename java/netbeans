Hello NetCAT participants,

    first of all thanks to all who helped with 8.1 Beta testing! Your 
contribution was just amazing! Today we are moving forward so I have 
created a new test run in Synergy called "NetBeans IDE 8.1 Full Testing" 
[1] which is now open for new assignments. The purpose of this 5 weeks 
long test run is to perform as many tests of NetBeans 8.1 development 
builds as possible unlike the much shorter sanity check of Beta 
candidate build.

[1] http://services.netbeans.org/synergy/client/app/#/run/18/v/2

    The process will be similar though. If you want to help with full 
testing of the NetBeans IDE 8.1 dailies make sure to do the following:

1. Visit the 8.1 Full Testing test run [1].
2. Scroll down a bit and click the "Volunteer" button.
3. Select your operating system in the "Platform" pull down menu.
4. Select appropriate specification version ("8.1", "8.0" etc.).
5. In the "Specification" section select some test specification you are 
willing to go through and then push "Create" button.
6. Go to the test run once again, scroll down to find the test 
assignment you have just created for yourself and start the testing by 
pushing ">" play button.
7. Perform all test actions from displayed test case and then click 
either "Passed" button if you achieved expected result, or "Failed" if 
something didn't work but be sure to provide bug ID in the "# issue" 
field. If you don't have more time for testing, just push "Pause". You 
can also click "Skip" if you for some reason cannot perform the test 
case. However, ALWAYS push "Pause" ONCE you know you cannot proceed with 
the testing any further not to bias time estimation data for others!
8. Our goal is to complete this testing by Monday 9/14 - 8:00 AM UTC. 
This time no Go/NoGo verdicts will be collected in a Wiki page.

    Tribe leaders please organize this effort within your tribes and 
either create assignments for your members or let them decide who will 
do what. And although five weeks seem like a plenty of time, don't leave 
the tests until the last week. And finally, Free Riders please join us 
too! :)

    Should you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask on this mailing 
list. Thanks to everyone who will help thoroughly test the 8.1 
development builds!

Happy testing,
-Jirka
