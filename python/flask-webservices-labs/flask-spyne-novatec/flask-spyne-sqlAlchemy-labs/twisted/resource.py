"""This is a blocking example running in a single-process twisted setup.

In this example, user code runs directly in the reactor loop. So unless your
code fully adheres to the asynchronous programming principles, you can block
the reactor loop. ::

    $ time curl -s "http://localhost:9757/block?seconds=10" > /dev/null & \
      time curl -s "http://localhost:9757/block?seconds=10" > /dev/null &
    [1] 27559
    [2] 27560

    real    0m10.026s
    user    0m0.005s
    sys     0m0.008s

    real    0m20.045s
    user    0m0.009s
    sys     0m0.005s

If you call sleep, it sleeps by returning a deferred: ::

    $ time curl -s "http://localhost:9757/sleep?seconds=10" > /dev/null & \
      time curl -s "http://localhost:9757/sleep?seconds=10" > /dev/null &
    [1] 27778
    [2] 27779

    real    0m10.012s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.000s

    real    0m10.013s
    user    0m0.000s
