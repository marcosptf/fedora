"""
This is a simple HelloWorld example to show the basics of writing
a webservice using spyne, starting a server, and creating a service
client.

Here's how to call it using suds:

#>>> from suds.client import Client
#>>> c = Client('http://localhost:8000/?wsdl')
#>>> c.service.say_hello('punk', 5)
(stringArray){
   string[] =
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
 }
#>>>
"""


from spyne import Application, rpc, ServiceBase, Iterable, Integer, Unicode

from spyne.protocol.soap import Soap11
from spyne.server.wsgi import WsgiApplication


class HelloWorldService(ServiceBase):
    @rpc(Unicode, Integer, _returns=Iterable(Unicode))
    def say_hello(ctx, name, times):
        """Docstrings for service methods appear as documentation in the wsdl.
        <b>What fun!</b>

        @param name the name to say hello to
        @param times the number of times to say hello
        @return the completed array
        """

        for i in range(times):
            yield u'Hello, %s' % name


application = Application([HelloWorldService], 'spyne.examples.hello.soap',
                          in_protocol=Soap11(validator='lxml'),
                          out_protocol=Soap11())

wsgi_application = WsgiApplication(application)
