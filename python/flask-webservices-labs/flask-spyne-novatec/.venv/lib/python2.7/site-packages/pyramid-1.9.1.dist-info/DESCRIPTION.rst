`Pyramid <https://trypyramid.com/>`_ is a small, fast, down-to-earth, open
source Python web framework. It makes real-world web application development
and deployment more fun, more predictable, and more productive.

.. code-block:: python

   from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
   from pyramid.config import Configurator
   from pyramid.response import Response

   def hello_world(request):
       return Response('Hello %(name)s!' % request.matchdict)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       with Configurator() as config:
           config.add_route('hello', '/hello/{name}')
           config.add_view(hello_world, route_name='hello')
           app = config.make_wsgi_app()
       server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 8080, app)
       server.serve_forever()

.. _changes_1.9.1:

1.9.1 (2017-07-13)
==================

- Add a ``_depth`` and ``_category`` arguments to all of the venusian
  decorators. The ``_category`` argument can be used to affect which actions
  are registered when performing a ``config.scan(..., category=...)`` with a
  specific category. The ``_depth`` argument should be used when wrapping
  the decorator in your own. This change affects ``pyramid.view.view_config``,
  ``pyramid.view.exception_view_config``,
  ``pyramid.view.forbidden_view_config``, ``pyramid.view.notfound_view_config``,
  ``pyramid.events.subscriber`` and ``pyramid.response.response_adapter``
  decorators. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3121 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3123

- Fix a circular import which made it impossible to import
  ``pyramid.viewderivers`` before ``pyramid.config``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3124

- Improve documentation to show the ``pyramid.config.Configurator`` being
  used as a context manager in more places.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3126

1.9 (2017-06-26)
================

- No major changes from 1.9b1.

- Updated documentation links for ``docs.pylonsproject.org`` to use HTTPS.

1.9b1 (2017-06-19)
==================

- Add an informative error message when unknown predicates are supplied. The
  new message suggests alternatives based on the list of known predicates.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3054

- Added integrity attributes for JavaScripts in cookiecutters, scaffolds, and
  resulting source files in tutorials.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/2548

- Update RELEASING.txt for updating cookiecutters. Change cookiecutter URLs to
  use shortcut.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/3042

- Ensure the correct threadlocals are pushed during view execution when
  invoked from ``request.invoke_exception_view``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3060

- Fix a bug in which ``pyramid.security.ALL_PERMISSIONS`` failed to return
  a valid iterator in its ``__iter__`` implementation.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3074

- Normalize the permission results to a proper class hierarchy.
  ``pyramid.security.ACLAllowed`` is now a subclass of
  ``pyramid.security.Allowed`` and ``pyramid.security.ACLDenied`` is now a
  subclass of ``pyramid.security.Denied``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3084

- Add a ``quote_via`` argument to ``pyramid.encode.urlencode`` to follow
  the stdlib's version and enable custom quoting functions.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3088

- Support `_query=None` and `_anchor=None` in ``request.route_url`` as well
  as ``query=None`` and ``anchor=None`` in ``request.resource_url``.
  Previously this would cause an `?` and a `#`, respectively, in the url
  with nothing after it. Now the unnecessary parts are dropped from the
  generated URL. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3034

- Revamp the ``IRouter`` API used by ``IExecutionPolicy`` to force
  pushing/popping the request threadlocals. The
  ``IRouter.make_request(environ)`` API has been replaced by
  ``IRouter.request_context(environ)`` which should be used as a context
  manager. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3086

1.9a2 (2017-05-09)
==================

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

- ``request.exception`` and ``request.exc_info`` will only be set if the
  response was generated by the EXCVIEW tween. This is to avoid any confusion
  where a response was generated elsewhere in the pipeline and not in
  direct relation to the original exception. If anyone upstream wants to
  catch and render responses for exceptions they should set
  ``request.exception`` and ``request.exc_info`` themselves to indicate
  the exception that was squashed when generating the response.

  Similar behavior occurs with ``request.invoke_exception_view`` in which
  the exception properties are set to reflect the exception if a response
  is successfully generated by the method.

  This is a very minor incompatibility. Most tweens right now would give
  priority to the raised exception and ignore ``request.exception``. This
  change just improves and clarifies that bookkeeping by trying to be
  more clear about the relationship between the response and its squashed
  exception. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3029 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3031

1.9a1 (2017-05-01)
==================

Major Features
--------------

- The file format used by all ``p*`` command line scripts such as ``pserve``
  and ``pshell``, as well as the ``pyramid.paster.bootstrap`` function
  is now replaceable thanks to a new dependency on
  `plaster <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/plaster/en/latest/>`_.

  For now, Pyramid is still shipping with integrated support for the
  PasteDeploy INI format by depending on the
  `plaster_pastedeploy <https://github.com/Pylons/plaster_pastedeploy>`_
  binding library. This may change in the future.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2985

- Added an execution policy hook to the request pipeline. An execution
  policy has the ability to control creation and execution of the request
  objects before they enter the rest of the pipeline. This means for a single
  request environ the policy may create more than one request object.

  The first library to use this feature is
  `pyramid_retry
  <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid-retry/en/latest/>`_.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2964

- CSRF support has been refactored out of sessions and into its own
  independent API in the ``pyramid.csrf`` module. It supports a pluggable
  ``pyramid.interfaces.ICSRFStoragePolicy`` which can be used to define your
  own mechanism for generating and validating CSRF tokens. By default,
  Pyramid continues to use the ``pyramid.csrf.LegacySessionCSRFStoragePolicy``
  that uses the ``request.session.get_csrf_token`` and
  ``request.session.new_csrf_token`` APIs under the hood to preserve
  compatibility. Two new policies are shipped as well,
  ``pyramid.csrf.SessionCSRFStoragePolicy`` and
  ``pyramid.csrf.CookieCSRFStoragePolicy`` which will store the CSRF tokens
  in the session and in a standalone cookie, respectively. The storage policy
  can be changed by using the new
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.set_csrf_storage_policy`` config directive.

  CSRF tokens should be used via the new ``pyramid.csrf.get_csrf_token``,
  ``pyramid.csrf.new_csrf_token`` and ``pyramid.csrf.check_csrf_token`` APIs
  in order to continue working if the storage policy is changed. Also, the
  ``pyramid.csrf.get_csrf_token`` function is injected into templates to be
  used conveniently in UI code.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2854 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3019

Minor Features
--------------

- Support an ``open_url`` config setting in the ``pserve`` section of the
  config file. This url is used to open a web browser when ``pserve --browser``
  is invoked. When this setting is unavailable the ``pserve`` script will
  attempt to guess the port the server is using from the
  ``server:<server_name>`` section of the config file but there is no
  requirement that the server is being run in this format so it may fail.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2984

- The ``pyramid.config.Configurator`` can now be used as a context manager
  which will automatically push/pop threadlocals (similar to
  ``config.begin()`` and ``config.end()``). It will also automatically perform
  a ``config.commit()`` and thus it is only recommended to be used at the
  top-level of your app. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2874

- The threadlocals are now available inside any function invoked via
  ``config.include``. This means the only config-time code that cannot rely
  on threadlocals is code executed from non-actions inside the main. This
  can be alleviated by invoking ``config.begin()`` and ``config.end()``
  appropriately or using the new context manager feature of the configurator.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2989

Bug Fixes
---------

- HTTPException's accepts a detail kwarg that may be used to pass additional
  details to the exception. You may now pass objects so long as they have a
  valid __str__ method. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2951

- Fix a reference cycle causing memory leaks in which the registry
  would keep a ``Configurator`` instance alive even after the configurator
  was discarded. Another fix was also added for the ``global_registries``
  object in which the registry was stored in a closure preventing it from
  being deallocated. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2967

- Fix a bug directly invoking ``pyramid.scripts.pserve.main`` with the
  ``--reload`` option in which ``sys.argv`` is always used in the subprocess
  instead of the supplied ``argv``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2962

Deprecations
------------

- Pyramid currently depends on ``plaster_pastedeploy`` to simplify the
  transition to ``plaster`` by maintaining integrated support for INI files.
  This dependency on ``plaster_pastedeploy`` should be considered subject to
  Pyramid's deprecation policy and may be removed in the future.
  Applications should depend on the appropriate plaster binding to satisfy
  their needs.

- Retrieving CSRF token from the session has been deprecated in favor of
  equivalent methods in the ``pyramid.csrf`` module. The CSRF methods
  (``ISession.get_csrf_token`` and ``ISession.new_csrf_token``) are no longer
  required on the ``ISession`` interface except when using the default
  ``pyramid.csrf.LegacySessionCSRFStoragePolicy``.

  Also, ``pyramid.session.check_csrf_token`` is now located at
  ``pyramid.csrf.check_csrf_token``.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2854 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3019

Documentation Changes
---------------------

- Added the execution policy to the routing diagram in the Request Processing
  chapter. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2993
