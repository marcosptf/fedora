Flask-Spyne
===========

Flask-Spyne is a `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_ extension which
provides `Spyne <http://spyne.io>`_ (formerly known as 
`soaplib <http://soaplib.github.io/soaplib/2_0/>`_) support. 
Includes SOAP, WSDL, JSON, XML, YAML and other transports and protocols.
Inspired by unofficial 
`Flask-Enterprise <http://massive.immersedcode.org/2011/staging/projects/default/python/flask-enterprise/>`_
extension (a wrapper on top of outdated `soaplib <http://soaplib.github.io/soaplib/2_0/>`_).

* `PyPI listing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Spyne>`_
