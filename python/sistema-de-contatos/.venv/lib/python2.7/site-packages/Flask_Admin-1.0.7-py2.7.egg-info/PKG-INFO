        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Flask-Admin is a batteries-included, simple-to-use Flask extension that lets you add admin interfaces to Flask
        applications. It is inspired by the *django-admin* package, but implemented in such a way that the developer has total control
        of the look, feel and functionality of the resulting application.
        
        Out-of-the-box, Flask-Admin plays nicely with various ORM's, including
        
        - `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,
        
        - `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_,
        
        - `pymongo <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>`_ and
        
        - `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_.
        
        It also boasts a simple file management interface and a `redis client <http://redis.io/>`_ console.
        
        Several usage examples are included in the */examples* folder. Feel free to add your own examples, or improve some of the existing ones, and submit them as a *pull-request*.
        
        The biggest feature of Flask-Admin is flexibility. It aims to provide a set of simple tools that can be used for
        building admin interfaces of any complexity. So, to start off with you can create a very simple application in no time,
        with auto-generated CRUD-views for each of your models. But then you can go further and customize those views & forms
        as the need arises.
        
        Flask-Admin is an active project, well-tested and production ready.
